      "answer": "In total, EUROMAT presents 30 statements on European policy which you choose to agree, disagree or react neutrally to. Ultimately, your answers will be compared against the positions of the German parties, and the results matched on percentage basis. For the compilation of statements and answers the six biggest parties have been contacted: CDU/CSU, SPD, B端ndnis90/Die Gr端nen, DIE LINKE, FDP and AFD. Five of those six parties have responded to our questionnaire. As we have not received a formal reply from AFD in time, we could not include them in the further EUROMAT evaluation."
